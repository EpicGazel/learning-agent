# Learning Agent

Learning Agent is an interactive conversational AI system that employs cutting-edge natural language processing techniques to engage in dynamic and insightful conversations. This project draws inspiration from the innovative work of [101dotxyz/GPTeam](https://github.com/101dotxyz/GPTeam) and [ayoreis/generative-agents](https://github.com/ayoreis/generative-agents) to create an intelligent agent capable of simulating human-like conversations.

## Overview

The Learning Agent project explores the capabilities of modern AI language models to generate contextually relevant responses, reflect on past interactions, and enhance its conversational skills over time. By combining advanced text generation algorithms, memory management, and self-improvement mechanisms, this agent aims to provide users with an engaging and insightful conversational experience.

## Features

- **Intelligent Responses:** The Learning Agent employs state-of-the-art language models to generate contextually relevant responses to user inputs, ensuring meaningful and engaging interactions.

- **Memory Reflection:** Leveraging memory recall techniques, the agent reflects on past interactions to enhance conversation continuity and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the user's persona.

- **Self-Improvement:** The agent has the ability to evaluate the importance of memories and assign ratings based on character profiles, enabling it to refine its understanding of human experiences.

- **Dynamic Conversation:** With the capacity to build deep relationships, the Learning Agent dynamically balances socializing with introspection, creating an immersive and captivating conversational partner.

## Getting Started

To experience the Learning Agent in action, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EpicGazel/learning-agent
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies

3. Run the `main.py` script to start a conversation with the Learning Agent:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
